# SANAD Protocol ($SNDX)

## Overview

SANAD Protocol is a decentralized blockchain-based system for creating and managing digital bonds on Solana. These bonds represent "Digital Promissory Notes" that are transparently stored and verifiable on-chain.

## Core Concept

The protocol transforms verbal or informal promises into legally binding digital bonds without relying on legal institutions or third-party intermediaries.

## Bond Structure

- Wallet addresses of issuer and recipient
- Agreement details: description, amount, maturity date
- On-chain signatures from both parties
- Timestamp and transaction ID

## Features

- Secure and transparent issuance
- Immutable on-chain records
- Easy verification via web interface
