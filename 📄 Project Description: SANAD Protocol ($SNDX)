📄 Project Description: SANAD Protocol ($SNDX)
SANAD Protocol is a decentralized blockchain-based system for creating, signing, and verifying digital agreements between two or more parties. Built on the Solana blockchain, it allows users to document any kind of commitment—such as service delivery, digital work, payment, or personal loan—as a “Digital Bond” that is transparently stored and verifiable on-chain.

🧠 Core Concept:
The idea behind SANAD is to transform verbal or informal promises into formal, traceable digital bonds, ensuring mutual accountability without needing legal institutions or third-party intermediaries.

Each bond includes:

Wallet addresses of both parties

Agreement details (description, amount, time)

On-chain signature from both sides

Timestamp and transaction ID

Optional features like PDF download or NFT conversion

🪙 Utility of $SNDX Token:
The $SNDX token is the native utility token of the protocol and is required for:

Creating and verifying digital bonds (1–5 SNDX per bond)

Converting bonds into NFTs (10 SNDX)

Accessing premium features

Participating in governance (DAO votes)

Earning rewards for consistent usage

⚙️ How It Works:
Initiator (Party A) fills out the bond form and signs it using a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom).

Pays a small fee in $SNDX to initiate the bond.

Receiver (Party B) reviews and signs the bond.

The bond is stored on-chain with full metadata and can be downloaded as a verified PDF.

Both parties gain reputation points based on their execution history.

🧾 Key Features:
On-chain digital agreements

Optional private/public visibility

Wallet-based reputation system

PDF download with signatures

NFT conversion of digital bonds

DAO voting system for protocol upgrades
